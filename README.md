### STEP 2: Copy MakerPF Content
Since MakerPF published project comes with the HTML5 one by default, we have to copy the abstract content to the native Android project.   

- Copye the content of the folder game into the assets folder of the MakerPF_Android project (Copy only the content of the folder not the folder itself)

### STEP 5: Publish
To publish an app to google play, you need a keystore, this keystore needs to be saved for further updates of the application.   
A same keystore can be used for more than one application

- In AndroidManifest.xml file, click **Export Project**
